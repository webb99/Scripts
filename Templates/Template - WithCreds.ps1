.SYNOPSIS
	The synopsis goes here. This can be one line, or many.
	This version of the template has inbuilt functions to capture credentials and store it securely for reuse
	Avoids the need to have plaintext passwords in the script

.DESCRIPTION
	The description is usually a longer, more detailed explanation of what the script or function does. 
	Take as many lines as you need.

	There are two main components of this script:
	1. Prepare Credentials
		This phase is run at least once.  It generates a secure hashed credential file that can be used by the script.
		Re-running this phase will overwrite the existing credential file.
		There are two modes provided:
			- DPAPI:  Recommended.  More secure. Requires both 'PrepareCredentials' and 'Execution' phases to be run by the same user account on the same machine to be able to decrypt key
			- AES:  Only to be used when service account cannot be used to run in interactive mode (and thus can't run PrepareCredentials). The AES.Key file that is generated is decryptable by anyone, so you must protect read access to this file using ACLs.
				
	2. Execution
		This phase is used to actually perform the exection of this script.  'Prepare Credentials' must have been run at least once.

.PARAMETER PrepareCredentials
	Run with this switch at least once.  Two methods are provided for generating the secure hashed credential file based on your requirements.

.PARAMETER Execution
	Run this switch when you want to run this script normally

.PARAMETER param1
	These parameters are automatched against the parameters defined in this script

.PARAMETER param2
	Use a .parameter for each one of your parameters

.EXAMPLE
	.\script-name.ps1 -PrepareCredentials

	FUNCTIONS

<#
.SYNOPSIS
	Initializes the output log file. 

.DESCRIPTION
	Execute this function at the beginning of your main code to ensure the log file path
	exists, and if it doesn't, create the folder paths to ensure future Write-Log calls
	will run without issue
	
	This function can also be modified to create log file headers
	
.PARAMETER overwrite
	Set this flag to overwrite any existing log files.  Otherwise default is to append
	to the existing log file
	
.PARAMETER headerText
	Optional ability to define some text at the start of eveyr initialization of the log file
	Useful if you are not overwriting the log file each time script is run]
#>
function Start-LogFile([switch]$overwrite, $headerText)
{
	# Check if log dir exists, if not, create it
	if(!(Test-Path $outputLogDir))
	{
		New-Item -type Directory $outputLogDir | out-null
	}
	Write-Output $headerText
	
	try
	{
		if($overwrite -eq $true)
		{
			set-content $outputLogPath $headerText
		}
		else
		{
			add-content $outputLogPath $headerText
		}
	}
	catch
	{
		Write-Warning "Could not initialize the log file: $outputLogPath"
	}
}

<#
.SYNOPSIS
	Writes to an entry into the output log file, and to the console if -Verbose is used

.DESCRIPTION
	This is a useful function for log file outputs.  Change the structure of this output
	as necessary for your scripts.
	If the -Verbose flag is set, then the log file message will also be written to the console
	using the Write-Verbose command
	
.PARAMETER type
	Optional, but can use to tag the log entry type. Recommend to use one of INFO,WARNING,ERROR
	Will default to INFO if non specified.
	NOTE:  If you wish to write a DEBUG log entry, use the Write-DebugLog function

.PARAMETER message
	The text to write to your ouput file
#>
function Write-Log($message, $type)
{
	if($type -eq $null -or $type -eq "")
	{
		$type = "INFO"

	}
	catch
	{

	}
}

<#
.SYNOPSIS
	Writes to an entry ino the output log file only if the -debug parameter was set in the script

.DESCRIPTION
	This is a useful function for performing debug logging.  It will use both the in built Write-Debug
	function as well as creating an entry to the log file with a DEBUG type 

.PARAMETER message
	The debug text to write to your ouput file
#>
function Write-DebugLog($message)
{
	Write-Debug $message
	try
	{
		# Only write to the log file if the -Debug parameter has been set
		if($script:debugFlag -eq $true)
		{
			# Log Entry Structure: [Date] [TYPE] [MESSAGE]
			$logEntry = (Get-Date -format u) + "`t" + "DEBUG" + "`t" + $message

		}
	}
	catch
	{
		Write-Warning "Could not write entry to output log file: $outputLogPath `nLog Entry:$message"
	}
}

<#
.SYNOPSIS
	Cleans up log files

.DESCRIPTION
	This is a useful function when scripts are run regularly and thus create lots of log files.
	Based on a log age date, it will remove all log files older than that period
	Uses a Global variable for the log age date

	.PARAMETER logPath
	Folder location for log files to remove

	.PARAMETER fileExtension
	Type of files to delete.  Use a wildcard format like "*.log"
#>
function Cleanup-LogFiles($logPath, $fileExtension)
{
	# Determine the date of which files older than specific period will be deleted
	$dateToDelete = (Get-Date).AddDays(-$logAgeLimit)
	$filesToDelete = Get-ChildItem $logPath -Include $fileExtension -Recurse | where{$_.LastWriteTime -le $dateToDelete}
	foreach($file in $filesToDelete)
	{
